USE employees;
# ** GROUP BY **

SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM employees;


# GROUP BY returns only the unique occurrences of the column specified.
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY first_name;

# Returns 1,275 results. These are all unique occurrences of first names





-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ** ASC/DESC **

#You can also specify ASC and DESC after columns named in the clause like so:

SELECT first_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY first_name DESC;



-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ** MULTIPLE COLUMNS **

SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name, first_name;

# Unique combinations of first and last names
# Grouped by last name alphabetically
# Within each last name group, sorted by first name
# Any column(s) that appear in the SELECT should also be in the GROUP BY clause.

# **AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS **
# An aggregate function works with data across all the rows in our result




# COUNT Function

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

# This ^^ will give total number of rows in employees table





SELECT COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%a%';

# This ^^ will give total number first names that do not have an a in them (118,195 total)





SELECT first_name, COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY first_name;

# This ^^ outputs each unique first name with an "a"
# This also will return the count of each of those names
# Results: 500 - There are 500 unique first names that do not have an "a" in them

# ** ALIASES **

# Aliases are commonly used to make temporary names for joins, or to change the output of a column's name.
# The alias name can be used in GROUP BY, ORDER BY, OR HAVING clause
# The original column name can still be used
# Do not use an alias in a where clause, bc  that value may not yet be determined, resulting in an error
# Aliases can help improve the readability of the output and query

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
