# SUB-QUERY - a nested SELECT within another query...

# SELECT column_a, column_b, column_c
# FROM table_a
# WHERE column_a IN (
#     SELECT column_a
#     FROM table_b
#     WHERE column_b = true
# );

-- Joins: often used when data is needed from two or more tables
-- returns only rows of data
-- tend to be faster than sub-queries
-- syntax can be more complex

-- Sub-queries: often used when the data of one table needs to be filtered by additional tables
-- may return...
-- rows of data (another table)
-- a single row
-- a column of values
-- a single value (scaler)
-- tend to be more readable than joins
-- must be a nested SELECT (can't nest an Insert, for example)
-- sub-queries may be nested infinitely (avoid double nested queries, if possible)
